## üí° Development Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: CORS Issues with iTunes API
**Problem**: Direct frontend calls to iTunes API were blocked due to CORS policy restrictions.

**Solution**: Built a custom Express.js proxy server that handles iTunes API requests on the backend, eliminating CORS issues while maintaining security through JWT authentication.

### Challenge 2: API Rate Limiting & Performance
**Problem**: Multiple rapid requests to iTunes API could cause rate limiting and poor user experience.

**Solution**: Implemented request optimization with proper error handling and response caching strategies. Added JWT authentication to control and monitor API usage.

### Challenge 3: State Management Across Sessions
**Problem**: User favorites were lost when closing the browser, creating poor user experience.

**Solution**: Integrated localStorage to persist user favorites across browser sessions, ensuring data remains available even after page refresh or browser restart.

### Challenge 4: Secure API Access
**Problem**: Needed to protect backend API endpoints while maintaining smooth user experience.

**Solution**: Implemented JWT-based authentication system with automatic token generation and refresh, providing security without requiring user login complexity.
